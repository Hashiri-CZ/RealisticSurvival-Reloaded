## 🌍 What is Harshlands?

**Harshlands** transforms your vanilla Minecraft server into a brutal, RLCraft-inspired survival experience — entirely server-side. No client mods. No modloader. Just drop it on your Spigot or Paper server and let your players discover what survival *actually* means.

Thirst will drain them. Temperature will punish them. Trees won't break with bare fists. Dragons will hunt them. And if they think the dark is safe — they haven't met what lives in it.

> **🎯 Built for server owners** who want RLCraft-level difficulty without forcing players to install anything.

---

## ✨ Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| 🌡️ **Temperature & Thirst** | Players must manage body temperature and hydration to survive. Deserts burn, tundras freeze, and water is no longer infinite. |
| 🪓 **No Tree Punching** | Forget punching trees — players need to craft basic tools from rocks and sticks before they can even gather wood. |
| 🐉 **Ice & Fire** | Dragons, sea serpents, and mythical creatures roam the world. Engage in epic boss-level encounters without a single client mod. |
| ⚔️ **Spartan Weaponry** | Dozens of new weapon types — halberds, rapiers, throwing knives, battleaxes — each with unique combat mechanics. |
| 🔥 **Spartan & Fire** | Dragonbone and Dragonsteel weapon variants forged from the creatures you slay. |
| 💎 **Baubles & Trinkets** | Equippable rings, amulets, and charms that grant passive buffs and abilities. |
| 👻 **Fear** | Darkness is deadly. Unseen terrors stalk players who dare to wander without light. |
| 🔧 **Fully Modular** | Every feature can be toggled, tweaked, or disabled independently. Your server, your rules. |

## 🚀 Installation

### Requirements

| Requirement | Version                  |
|-------------|--------------------------|
| Minecraft | `1.21.11`, `26.1.2`      |
| Server | Spigot, Paper, or Purpur |
| Java | 21+                      |

### Quick Start

1. Download the latest release from [Releases](https://github.com/Hashiri-CZ/Harshlands/releases)
2. Place the `.jar` file in your server's `plugins/` folder
3. Restart your server
4. Configure modules in `plugins/Harshlands/config.yml`
5. Watch your players *suffer* — in the best way possible

> [!NOTE]
> **Harshlands supports Minecraft `1.21.11` and `26.1.2`.** A single JAR targets both.

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

Every module is independently configurable. After first launch, you'll find configuration files in:

```
plugins/Harshlands/
├── config.yml              # Master config — enable/disable modules
├── tough-as-nails.yml      # Temperature & thirst settings
├── no-tree-punching.yml    # Early-game progression rules
├── ice-and-fire.yml        # Creature spawning & loot tables
├── spartan-weaponry.yml    # Weapon stats & recipes
├── baubles.yml             # Trinket effects & drop rates
└── fear.yml                # Darkness mechanics & intensity
```

Want a server that's hard but not *RLCraft* hard? Turn off Fear and reduce temperature damage. Want pure chaos? Crank everything to max. The choice is yours.
